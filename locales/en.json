    "BET_TYPES": "<h3>Bet Types</h3><strong>Small/Big</strong><p>A Small bet wins if the total of the three dice is between 4 and 10, while a Big bet wins if the total is between 11 and 17. Both lose when the result is any triple, meaning all three dice show the same number.</p><strong>Odd/Even</strong><p>This bet predicts whether the total will be odd or even. If all three dice form a triple, this bet automatically loses. The Odd range excludes triples that happen to be odd, and the Even range excludes even triples.</p><strong>Double</strong><p>Placing a Double bet means you're wagering that exactly two of the three dice will show the same face. If all three dice match, the Double bet still pays at the same rate since the condition of having at least two matching dice is satisfied.</p><strong>Specific Triple</strong><p>A Specific Triple bet focuses on one exact triple, such as three 2s or three 5s. You win only if all three dice match the specific number you chose. It's among the highest-paying bets due to its lower probability.</p><strong>Any Triple</strong><p>Any Triple covers all six possible triples at once. You win if the three dice match any single number (e.g., three 1s, three 2s, etc.), offering a broader but still relatively rare outcome.</p><strong>Three Dice Total</strong><p>This wager is placed on one of the totals from 4 to 17. Each total offers a unique payout based on its likelihood, with less frequent totals having higher payouts.</p><strong>Two Dice Combo</strong><p>A Two Dice Combo bet covers any two distinct numbers (such as 3 and 6) appearing among the three dice. It doesn't matter which dice show these two faces, as long as both appear somewhere in the final roll.</p><strong>Single</strong><p>A Single bet is placed on one of the six faces (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). If your chosen number appears once, you receive a standard payout; if it appears twice or three times, you earn higher rewards.</p>",
